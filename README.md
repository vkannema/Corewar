# Corewar

In this project we created “arena” in which programs fight against one another (the “Champions”).

ASM

The assembler: this is the program that compiles champions and translate them from the assembly language into “Bytecode”.

VM

The virtual machine: It’s the “arena” in which champions are executed.
